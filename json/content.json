      "description":"My work spans rigging, character modelling, hard-surface modelling, VFX/CGI, asset creation, logo animation, and illustration. I develop optimized rigs for both characters and mechanical assets, ensuring expressive and functional animation. My character modelling focuses on cel-shaded and stylized designs, though I also work with realistic texturing and 3D printing, including my original series Dwei Bar. For hard-surface modelling, I specialize in mechanical and structural forms using Blender and Marvelous Designer for cloth-based elements like furniture. While VFX and CGI are not my main focus, I can produce cinematic visuals for personal and professional projects. In asset creation, I craft game-ready models with low polycounts and baked textures to maximize performance. My side projects include logo animation in Blender, bringing brands to life with 3D depth, and illustration in Clip Studio Paint and Photoshop, often extended into animated GIFs."

      "summary": "Showcases a range of rigging work, from organic character rigs to mechanical setups, emphasizing flexibility, functionality, and animation-ready performance.",
      "description": "This section highlights my rigging capabilities across different types of models. For the character, I built a complete biped rig featuring IK/FK systems, a spline-based spine, and intuitive controls for smooth deformation and natural movement. For the bicycle, I created a mechanical rig that accurately simulates functional parts such as wheels, pedals, and steering, ensuring precise motion and animator-friendly usability. Together, these works demonstrate my adaptability in rigging both organic and hard-surface assets for various animation needs.",
      "workflow": "My workflow begins with identifying the product and adjusting textures and rigging to suit its specific needs. For these projects, I often rely on shapekeys, as they provide a non-destructive and efficient way to make adjustments. Final renders are created based on client specifications, typically delivered in 4K PNG format for both images and animations.",

      "description": "Since 2018, I have focused on cel-shaded and stylized character modeling, blending anime-inspired aesthetics with expressive design. While my primary strength lies in stylization, I also have the versatility to create realistic textures when required. My flagship project, “Dwei Bar,” is an original series that highlights my ability to not only model characters but also develop a cohesive artistic world around them. This series serves as a signature representation of my creative identity, demonstrating how I bring characters from concept to fully realized 3D assets. Additionally, my work extends into 3D printing, giving these characters a tangible presence. With this combination of artistic originality and technical execution, I deliver characters that are both visually striking and production-ready.",
      "workflow": "I begin modeling with the client’s concept art, focusing on silhouette, depth, and proportion to draft a model that establishes accurate structure. For rigging, I adapt my approach to the project’s style—drawing from VTuber and anime references for expressive rigs, studying anatomy for realistic models, or designing mechanical rigs like Gundam that balance humanoid motion with robotic function. Building on the rig, I animate with attention to weight, balance, and timing to deliver smooth, expressive motion suited for both interactive and cinematic use.",

My workflow blends precision editing, motion design, and storytelling to deliver cohesive visuals that maintain rhythm, tone, and emotional impact. Each project is handled end-to-end — from raw footage organization to visual effects, color grading, and audio refinement.",
      "workflow": "For original character commissions, I begin by gathering the client’s vision with questions about the character’s attitude, gender, clothing, and any preferred details. I create a sketch for client approval before moving on to coloring. This process ensures the final artwork meets their expectations while allowing for adjustments along the way.",
